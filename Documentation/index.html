							<h3>ApkExpansionFiles</h3>
							<p>Help in manage the apk expansion files download</p>
						<p>Apk upload size limit is currently 100MB but in case your app require more data the Android Console allow to "attach" two files connected to your app. Official documentation about this feature is <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files" target="_blank">here</a>, is <u>strongly suggested</u> to read it for allow a better comprension about how to use this tool. Usually the expansion files are downloaded by the Google Play together with the main app but in case the user delete it or some other problem occurs and the file will not be available anymore the app have to download again usually at startup. In this phase is required the java code of the two libraries explained in the documentation, the <i>Google Play Licensing Library</i> and the <i>Google Play APK Expansion Library</i>. However, at the time this post was written, there are a couple of problems. The official documentation suggest to get these libraries through the Android SDK Manager and then create two modules using the libraries just obtained. The problem here is the code of there libraries is very very old and use some deprecated dependencies making difficult the compilation using Qt Creator. It exist an updated version of these two libraries always developed by Google <a href="https://github.com/google/play-apk-expansion" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/play-licensing" target="_blank">here</a>. However also these two latest libraries are not supported by a long time and doesn't work very well in the latest versions of Android, from 8 and above. For this reasons this tool implement the two updated version community supported <a href="https://github.com/bolein/better-apk-expansion" target="_blank">better-apk-expansion</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bolein/better-licensing" target="_blank">better-licensing</a> that make the same job but are updated enough for support the new notify feature of Android 8. I only made a small modify for support the Qt multi language engine. In the version inside the tool the java library ask to the C++ level for the info text to use in the Android notify label allowing the Qt language selector to select the correct language string.</p>
							<p>Remember for have the download library working as expected you have to set the following permission in your app:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;manifest ...&gt;
    &lt;!-- Required to access Google Play Licensing --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.CHECK_LICENSE" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Required to download files from Google Play --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Required to keep CPU alive while downloading files
        (NOT to keep screen awake) --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Required to poll the state of the network connection
        and respond to changes --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Required to check whether Wi-Fi is enabled --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Required to read and write the expansion files on shared storage --&gt;
    &lt;uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/manifest&gt;</pre>
							<p>Also note, in case your Android app is target for version 23 or above you have to explicitly ask for the <i>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</i> permission cause this is one of the "dangerous" permission. You can use the other <a href="#AppPermissions">AppPermissions</a> tool available in this library. Also you have to correctly the various part of the library by addicting these lines inside your <i>AndroidManifest.xml</i> file:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;application&gt;
.....
&lt;service android:name="com.google.android.vending.expansion.downloader.impl.DownloaderService" android:enabled="true"/&gt;
&lt;receiver android:name="com.google.android.vending.expansion.downloader.impl.DownloaderService$AlarmReceiver" android:enabled="true"/&gt;
&lt;/application&gt;</pre>
							<p><u>Please note from now it's assumed you have read the documentation</u> and already know the type and the format of expansion files is possible to upload and how the licensing engine work. First initialization is the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.base64PublicKey = "app_public_key_here";
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.salt = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20];
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.main.version = 1;
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.main.size = 123456789;
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.patch.version = 1;
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.patch.size = 123456789;</pre>
<p>The <i>base64PublicKey</i> can be found in the Android Console app info and the <i>salt</i> is a random array of 20 bytes you have to generate by yourself. This is required for encrypt your data stored of the server. <i>Version</i> and <i>size</i> is required for identify your main and patch file. You can upload only the main file (and then you have to set only the <i>main</i> fields), these info are used to check if the current expansion files eventually already present in the device correspond in term of version number and file size.</p>
							<p>Once configured the basic info you can check the operation to make by calling the following function:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.startDownloadFiles()</pre>
							<p>If this function will return:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.APKEF_NO_DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED</pre>
							<p>mean your expansion file are already available in the device than there is nothing to do, you can proceed with the app execution. In case of return:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.APKEF_DOWNLOAD_STARTED
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.APKEF_LVL_CHECK_REQUIRED</pre>
							<p>mean the apk expansion files download is started than you have to manage the download progress info. A download notify will be showed in the system status bar but your app should also show a progress control to inform the user regarding the operation in progress and that he have to wait. All other return codes are basically error conditions, check the library sources to see all the possible error types.</p>
							<img src="images/apkexpansionfiles1.png">
							<p>During download phase the tool generate two signals updating you about current status as follow:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">Connections {
    target: QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles
    onDownloadStateChanged: {
        switch(newState)
        {
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_COMPLETED:
                ...
                break;
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_FAILED_UNLICENSED:
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_FAILED_FETCHING_URL:
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_FAILED_SDCARD_FULL:
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_FAILED_CANCELED:
            case QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.STATE_FAILED:
                ...
                break;
        }
    }
    onDownloadProgress: {
        var time = new Date(timeRemaining);
        downloadProgressBar.to = overallTotal;
        downloadProgressBar.value = overallProgress;
        downloadSizeLabel.text = (overallProgress / (1024*1024)).toFixed(2) + "MB/" + (overallTotal / (1024*1024)).toFixed(2) + "MB";
        downloadTimeLabel.text = "Time left: ";
        if(timeRemaining &gt; 1000 * 60 * 60)
            downloadTimeLabel.text += ("0" + time.getHours()).substr(-2) + ":" + ("0" + time.getMinutes()).substr(-2);
        else
            downloadTimeLabel.text += ("0" + time.getMinutes()).substr(-2) + ":" + ("0" + time.getSeconds()).substr(-2);
    }
}</pre>
							<p><i>onDownloadStateChanged</i> have the <i>newState</i> param informing about the download state changed. Check the sources for all the possible values. <i>onDownloadProgress</i> report info about the download process like current size and time left. Once download completed or if your expansion files are already available is possible to retrieve the full path of both files by use the following functions:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.mainFileName()
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.patchFileName()</pre>
							<p>During download phase always is possible to abort, stop and restart download by using the functions below:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.abortDownload()
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.pauseDownload()
QtAndroidApkExpansionFiles.continueDownload()</pre>
							<p>A specific note regarding the function <i>getString()</i>. It return an info string connected with the current download status and some other info. It's used internally to pass correct language string to the java library but you can use also for the main interface as in demo example.</p>

							<h3>AppPermissions</h3>
							<p>This tool allow to request Android app permissions in an easier way.</p>
							<p>From Android version 23 (Marshmallow) there are a list of special permission called "dangerous" because are directly connected to personal data of the user like calendar, contacts list and so on (official documentation <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview" target="_blank">here</a>). If your app is target for this version and above and your manifest file contains one of the dangerous permissions you have to explicitly get the user authorization for have such permission granted. In the demo app four of these dangerous permission will be requested as follow:</p>
							<img src="images/apppermissions1.png">
							<p>There are two functions for request permissions, one accept a list of permissions for allow a unique request for all and another can be used to ask for a single permission only. In this example the multiple request function will be used as follow:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">import QtAndroidTools 1.0
...
readonly property var permissionsNameList: ["android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE","android.permission.READ_CALENDAR","android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE","android.permission.READ_CONTACTS"]
...
QtAndroidAppPermissions.requestPermissions(permissionsNameList)</pre>
							<p>The call of  this function will have a result to show the system message informing the user the app require the specific permissions and ask for approval:</p>
							<img src="images/apppermissions2.png">
							<p>Once the user will finish to make the choice a signal will be generated with a list of struct as param as follow:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">Connections {
    target: QtAndroidAppPermissions
    onRequestPermissionsResults: {
        for(var i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++)
        {
            if(results[i].granted === true)
            {
                setPermissionGranted(results[i].name, true);
            }
            else
            {
                if(QtAndroidAppPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionInfo(results[i].name) === true)
                {
                    if(results[i].name === permissionsNameList[0])
                        requestPermissionWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.open();
                    else if(results[i].name === permissionsNameList[1])
                        requestPermissionREAD_CALENDAR.open();
                    else if(results[i].name === permissionsNameList[2])
                        requestPermissionREAD_PHONE_STATE.open();
                    else if(results[i].name === permissionsNameList[3])
                        requestPermissionREAD_CONTACTS.open();
                }
                else
                {
                    setPermissionGranted(results[i].name, false);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
							<p>Each item in the list contain the param <i>name</i> containing the permission string name and the boolean field <i>granted</i> informing if the user allowed the app to get the permission or not. Please note, if you app will be target under version 23 this signal will be emitted immediately without show any messagebox and, obviously, with all the permission automatically granted. This for allow the code working in the same way independently by the Android target version selected. In case the user don't granted a permission this special call is used in the code:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidAppPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionInfo(...)</pre>
							<p>This function is quite particular and return true only in the case a first attempt to ask to permission has been denied. Basically it "suggest" to show a message to the user explaining why your app need the specific permission before retry to ask for permission again:</p>
							<img src="images/apppermissions3.png">
							<p>Once explained the reasons you can ask again for the same permission by using this time the single request function:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidAppPermissions.requestPermission(...)</pre>
							<p>Now please note a very important particular. Theoretically you can ask for the same permission infinitely, however from the second time you ask for the same permission the system message window will appear as following:</p>
							<img src="images/apppermissions4.png">
							<p>As you can note in this case there is a checkbox allowing the user to not be annoyed by your request anymore (<i>Don't ask again</i>). If the user will check it and will deny the request again any next request for the permission will be automatically denied without show any message than be careful in decide when ask for permission and, above all, to explain very clearly why you need that permission. After the second try the signal reporting the choice result will be generated again with the updated situation:</p>

							<p>There are only the following functions, the first return the list of device albums and the second return the list of all images inside the album (full absolute path of each image):</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">import QtAndroidTools 1.0
							
QtAndroidImages.getAlbumsList()
QtAndroidImages.getAlbumImagesList(albumId)</pre>
							<p>In particular the first function return an array of structures with the following two properties:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">album.id
album.name</pre>
							<p>As is possible easily undertand the first id the <i>id</i> of the album (to use as param for the second function) and the second is the <i>name</i> of the album as saved in the Android device.</p>

							<h3>Notification</h3>
							<p>This tool will show Android system notifications.</p>
							<p>As usual for better understand how to use notification is strongly reccomended to read the official documentation <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
							<p>The tool <i>QtAndroidNotification</i> allow to compose and show a system notification in a very easy way as follow:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">QtAndroidNotification {
   id: notification
   title: "Notification title"
   text: "This is the notification content"
   expandableText: "This is a very very very very very very very very very very long expandable content"
   channelName: "Notification channel"
   smallIconName: "notification_icon_name"
   largeIconSource: ":/images/logo.jpg"
}</pre>
							<p>Available notification properties are the the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>title</i> : title of the notification.</li>
								<li><i>text</i> : main content of the notification. This filed is mandatory and is limited to one line size.</li>
								<li><i>expandableText</i> : in case you need to show a text longer than a line you can set this property with your full text. Based to the Android version the result will be a little different but, in any case, this part will be showed in addition of the text content.</li>
								<li><i>channelName</i> : in Android 8.0 and above notification have to be associated to a channel, this for allow user to disable notifications associated to the specific channel. This is a mandatory value.</li>
								<li><i>smallIconName</i> : another mandatory value. Basically this is the special format icon showed on system bar connected to the notification. You can find many tools allow to make this icon in the right format. Unfortunately, for support old Android verion, is not possible to pass this icon from Qt resource or from a image file on storage but have to be mandatorily use the apk drawable folders. For try to simplify you don't need to get the full app path but you simply can insert the name of the icon file (without extension) you set into drawable folder (check the demo source).</li>
								<li><i>largeIconSource</i> : large icon you can show into notification. You can use an image from Qt resource system of from a file.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In case you need to show a progress bar in the notification there are available the following additional properties:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><i>progressBar.max</i> : the max value of the progress bar.</li>
								<li><i>progressBar.current</i> : The current value of the progress bar between zero and the max value.</li>
								<li><i>progressBar.indeterminate</i> : boolean value for set the prograss bar in the indeterminate state. The result is an indicator that has the same style as the progress bar above, except the progress bar is a continuous animation that does not indicate completion.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The progress bar is showed if you set the max value with a value greater than zero. For hide the progress bar set zero to both max nad current properties value.</p>
							<p>The following methods can be called:</p>
							<pre class="prettyprint">show()
cancel()</pre>
							<p>Once set all the required properties you can show the notification by calling the corresponding function. The notification can be read and cleared directly by the user you can remove from app by using the <i>cancel()</i> call.</p>
